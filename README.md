    Using Diffraction gravity you can split a beam of light into its individual wavelengths, just like water droplets splitting sunlight into rainbow.Measuring the intensity of light observed at each wavelength gives the stars characteristic spectrum.Hydrogen, a major component of most stars absorbs light at precisely 656.3 nanometers.A star spectrum is blueshifted that is, shifted to shorter wavelengths if its moving towards you and reshifted to longer wavelengths if its moving away.In this project, used Matlab to find the observed wavelength of the hydrogen alpha line of HD94028 and compare it to the known wavelength of the hydrogen absorption to determine how fast the star is moving away from the earth with precise spectral measurements over time.Astronomers use this technique to discover the slight oscillators that demonstrate the presence of planets.
